App name: My Portfolio

total five pages: include home, about me, projects, services and contact me

to describe my Portfolio

in project page I used AngularJS and in the contact me page I used the nodemailer to send a email to myself when somebody leave me a message.


I used a tamplate for my html and css code, but I don't remember where it comes from.
It is a previous project I did for an another student's communication presentation.
